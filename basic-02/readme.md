# PHP Basics LVL 2 Exercises

- Get to your submission folder under exercises/php-basics-01

- You should create a PHP file for each step with the name of the step.

> e.g : Step_1.php

- COMMIT AFTER EACH STEP, call each commit by the name of the step

## Goals

- Learn general basic programming syntax as applied to PHP
- **Competencies**:
  - <kbd>Echo</kbd>
  - <kbd>Functions</kbd>
  - <kbd>Variables</kbd>
  - <kbd>PHP Built in functions</kbd>

## Step 1

> Write a PHP script to display the following strings.

> **You can only use Echo or Print.**

Expected Output :

```txt
Tomorrow I 'll learn PHP global variables.
This is a bad command: sudo rm -rf /
```

>> ...

## Step 2

> Write a PHP function to test whether a number is greater than 30, 20 or 10

**Sample:**

```php
<?php

function greaterFn($num){
  // ...
  return 'string';
}
greaterFn(40); // 40 is greater than 30
greaterFn(21); // 21 is greater than 20
greaterFn(12); // 12 is greater than 10
greaterFn(8);  // 8 is less than 10

```

>> ******

## Step 3

> Write a PHP program to swap two variables.

Example:

```php
$var1 = 32;
$var2 = 45;
```

...

```php
$var1; // 45
$var2; // 32
```

>> ...

## Step 4

> Write a PHP program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. Return true if the number is Armstrong otherwise return false.

In PHP a double star ( ** ) is an **Exponentiation** operator, 2 ^ 5 === 2 ** 5 | 2 ^ 2 === 2 ** 2

> Note: An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer so that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself. 

> For example, 153 is an Armstrong number since 1 ** 3 + 5 ** 3 + 3 ** 3 = 153

>> ...

## Step 5

> Write a PHP program(function) to convert word to digit.
Use switch case.

```text
Input: zero
Output: 0

Input one
Output 1

Input: five
Output: 5
```

>> ...

## Step 6

> Write a PHP program to compute the sum of the digits of a number.

> Hint: Input $num = '54321'; $num[0]; // 5, $num[3] // 2

> Use `strlen($num)` to get the length of the string

>> ...

## Step 7

> Write a PHP program to replace a string "Python" with "PHP" and "Python" with " PHP" in a given string.

> Input: English letters (including single byte alphanumeric characters, blanks, symbols) are given on one line. The length of the input character string is 1000 or less.

> Use [`str_replace`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php)

>> ...

## Step 8

> Write a PHP program to check whether a given positive integer is a power of two.

> Input : 4

> Output :4 is power of 2

>> ******

## Step 9

> Write a PHP program to compute and return the square root of a given number.

```txt
Input: 16
Output: 4
```
>> ...

## Step 10

Write a PHP function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not?

A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

>> Hint use strrev. `strrev("Hello"); // olleH`
>> ...

## Step 11

> Write a function to check whether a number is prime or not.

>> Note: A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Hints

- Writing a programme mean that you need to create a function
- Writing a script mean that you aren't required to write a function
